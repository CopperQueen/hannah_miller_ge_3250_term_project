# Interactive Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization
*Author:  ***Hannah Miller*** (hannahm@mtu.edu)*

This project aims to fetch, process, analyze, and visualize earthquake data alongside tectonic plate boundaries to demonstrate the correlation between seismic activity and plate tectonics using Python.

## Project Context

This is a term project for GE 3250: Computational Geoscience.

## Getting Started

1.  [Environment Setup](./project_setup_precursors.md): Before running the analysis, ensure the development environment is configured correctly. Follow the instructions which covers installing VS Code, required extensions, and setting up API access for AI assistance.
2.  [Project Plan](./project_plan.md): The detailed plan, including data sources, processing steps, analysis methods, and visualization techniques using Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, etc.) within an iPython Notebook, is outlined.
3.  [Project Learnings](./project_learnings.md): What I learned and taught myself to complete this project.
4.  [Data Sources](./data_sources.md): Citations resources.
5.  [Project Deliverables](./deliverables.md): Project brief and results.
