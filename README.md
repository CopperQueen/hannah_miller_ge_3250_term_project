# Interactive Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization
*Author:  ***Hannah Miller*** (hannahm@mtu.edu)*

This project aims to fetch, process, analyze, and visualize earthquake data alongside tectonic plate boundaries to demonstrate the correlation between seismicity and plate tectonics using Python.

## Project Context

This is a term project for GE 3250: Computational Geoscience.

## Getting Started

1.  **Environment Setup**: Before running the analysis, ensure your development environment is configured correctly. Follow the instructions in [Project Setup Precursors](./project_setup_precursors.md) which covers installing VS Code, required extensions, and setting up API access for AI assistance.
2.  **Project Implementation**: The detailed plan, including data sources, processing steps, analysis methods, and visualization techniques using Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, etc.) within an iPython Notebook, is outlined in the [Project Plan](./project_plan.md).
