# 🌍 Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization and Analysis 🌋

*Author: 👩‍💻 ***Hannah Miller*** (hannahm@mtu.edu)*

## ***Question to answer:***
"Is there a quantifiable correlation between earthquake magnitude and the distance from the nearest fault line, and does this relationship vary by fault type? Specifically, can earthquake magnitude be used to predict proximity to a fault line, or vice versa?"

This project aims to fetch, process, analyze, and visualize earthquake data 📊 alongside tectonic plate boundaries 🗺️ to demonstrate the correlation between seismic activity and plate tectonics using Python 🐍.

## 🎓 Project Context

This is a term project for GE 3250: Computational Geoscience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **💻 Environment Setup**: [Environment Setup](./project_setup_precursors.md): Before running the analysis, ensure the development environment is configured correctly. Follow the instructions which covers installing VS Code, required extensions, and setting up API access for AI assistance.
2.  **📝 Project Plan**: [Project Plan](./project_plan.md): The detailed plan, including data sources, processing steps, analysis methods, and visualization techniques using Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, etc.) within an iPython Notebook, is outlined.
3.  **💡 Project Learnings**: [Project Learnings](./project_learnings.md): What I learned and taught myself to complete this project.
4.  **💾 Data Sources**: [Data Sources](./data_sources.md): Citations resources.
